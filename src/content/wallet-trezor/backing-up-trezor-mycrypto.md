All you need is the 24 seed words that you wrote down when you first initially setup the TREZOR. You can use the words on MyCrypto to recover your ETH/ETC/Tokens.

If you used any passphrases on the TREZOR and used any ETH/ETC/Tokens with a passphrase protected wallet, then you will also need the relevant passphrase.
