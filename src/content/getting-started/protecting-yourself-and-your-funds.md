Being your own bank can be empowering, but it also means you are responsible for keeping your assets safe & secure. You need to ensure you have backups of your private key, keystore file, or mnemonic phrase and you need to protect yourself from hackers and scammers. 

Here's some tips to stay safe. You can do this!

### Buy a Hardware Wallet.

One of the safest &amp; easiest ways to store your ETH, Tokens, ETC, BTC, and many other assets is via a <strong>Ledger</strong>, <strong>Trezor</strong>, or <strong>Keepkey</strong. Hardware wallets are <strong>not</strong> just USB drives. They actually store your private key in super secure enclave, which ensures the private key **never** leaves your device. Phishers can't get them. Malware can't get them. Keyloggers can't get them. If you hold more than $200 worth of crypto, please invest in one of these hardware wallets: 

- [Buy a Ledger](https://www.ledgerwallet.com/r/1985?path=/products/)

- [Buy a Trezor](https://shop.trezor.io/?offer_id=10&aff_id=1735)

- [Buy a Keepkey](http://keepkey.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=1&aff_id=4086)

If you don't want one of these nifty devices, use [cold storage](https://support.mycrypto.com/offline/ethereum-cold-storage-with-mycrypto.html) for a majority of your savings. Please. Pretty please.

### Bookmark your crypto sites.

Scammers create websites that look like other websites in order to trick you into giving them your private key, keystore file, mnemonic phrase, username, password, or other secret information. They trick you into visiting these websites by sending you scary emails, messages on Telegram, fake Google ads, and more. This is commonly known as "phishing" and is hard for even the most careful people to detect.

If give these attackers access to your account, they will steal your funds.

Instead of clicking a link to MyCrypto, Coinbase, Binance, ShapeShift, or any other cryptocurrency website, **only use bookmarks that you create yourself.**


### Install [EtherAddressLookup](https://harrydenley.com/ethaddresslookup-chrome-extension-release/) or [MetaMask](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn). 

**These will prevent you from going to a malicious crypto website!**

### Use the MyCrypto Desktop Appliation & run it offline.

[You can learn how to run locally & offline here.]((https://support.mycrypto.com/offline/running-mycrypto-locally.html).)

### Back it up!
*  Think about where you’ve put your cold storage and recovery passphrase. Whether it’s a paper or hardware wallet, it’s important to put these physical items in **two, physically separate, secure locations**.
*   Maybe find a new spot around the house, open a safety deposit box, and/or invest in a fireproof document bag (less than $20 on Amazon).
*  Example 1: Your hardware lives with you at your house in your super-secret hiding spot. The words you wrote down for your backup phrase live in a safety deposit box.
*  Example 2: Make a copy of your existing paper wallet. Keep one at your house and one in a sealed, discreet envelope at a trustworthy relative’s house with important documents like birth certificates. You don’t have to let them know it’s crypto.


### Don't trust messages, addresses, or URLs sent via private message. Always verify information with a seconda source.
*  Don’t click any link regarding anything crypto, money, banking, or a service like Dropbox / Google Drive / Gmail in any email or DM or public chat room.
*  If you do accidentally click, do not enter any information on the page.
*  Never enter your private keys, passwords, sensitive data on a website that you were sent via message.


### Turn on 2FA!
*  Enable 2-Factor Authentication on every account that allows it.
*  Download and install Google Authenticator for [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&hl=en) or [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8).
*  Go through your accounts: Coinbase, Poloniex, Google, Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox, iCloud, Amazon, GoDaddy, CloudFlare, and any other site you use.
*  Turn on 2FA with Google Authenticator.
*  Avoid SMS and Authy for 2FA. Your phone number can be easily stolen and used to gain access to your account, especially in crypto. If you absolutely must use Authy, turn multi-device support off.
*  Turn off "Recovery Email" and "Reovery Phone Number" on your Google/Gmail accounts [here](https://myaccount.google.com/security). 
*  PS: MyCrypto is client-side, meaning 2FA won't do anything in our case. 2FA is for ensuring the security of your password on a server.


### Always double check the URL.
*  Check it. Then, check it again right before entering any information. This is especially important for any sites that require usernames, passwords, email addresses, private keys, and any other personal information. 
*  SSL certs do not mean a site is trustworthy, just that they bought an SSL cert. Not sure about the correct URL? Cross reference Reddit, Twitter, Github, Slack and wherever else the project hangs out.
*  Github URLs are much easier to fake and much easier to miss. Instead of downloading from that random URL on reddit, seek out the URL on your own.

### Always verify that the site you landed on is legit.
*  Especially if you are about to enter your private key or download an application. What is legit? A service that people have used for a decent period of time with good results. If the URL has been registered in the last week or the site "just launched", err on the side of caution and avoid it for a while.

### Google the service name + "scam" or "reviews".
*  Scam sites rarely last long. Value real comments by real people over a random blog. Value a collection of information over a single source. Understand that legit services will likely have a mix of positive and negative reviews over a long period of time. Scam sites typically have no one talking about them, everyone yelling about how they got robbed, or the most perfect reviews ever. The latter one is just as red of a flag as the first one.

### Don't ever run remote-access software, like TeamViewer.
*  Don't ever...but especially not on a computer with keys on them. The number of security holes in these programs is atrocious. You 2FA your entire life, but then let a single string of characters give someone access to your entire computer & every account.

### Install an adblocker that actually turns off Google/Bing Ads
*  We recommend going with uBlock Orgin. If you are already using Adblock Plus, it does not hide Google Ads from you. Go into your Adblock Plus settings and uncheck the box that says “Allow some non-intrusive advertising”.

### Don’t click on advertisements
*  With or without an adblocker, you should never, ever click on advertisements.

### If you have accidentally visited or typed a malicious site, clean out your recent history and autocomplete
*  This will prevent you from typing kra… and having it autocomplete to the malicious krakken.com.

### No one is giving you free or discounted crypto. No one is sending your more crypto if you send them a little crypto
*  This scam is especially popular on Twitter. The fake person replies to the real person with some fancy "GIVEAWAY". The fake person's username is actually different—look carefully.
*  Another version of this scam promises free or discounted crypto if you complete a survey. Do not waste your time, they will try to steal your money.

### Only unlock your wallet when you want to send a transaction. Check your balance via https://etherscan.io/, https://ethplorer.io/ or https://www.etherchain.org/

### Lastly: use your brain. If it is too good to be true, it probably is.

* Think for a moment. Don't assume, ask. Don't blindly follow, question. If something doesn't seem right...if you feel like the luckiest fucker on Earth...or if you find yourself asking, "I wonder why I haven't seen this on reddit yet", there is likely a reason.
