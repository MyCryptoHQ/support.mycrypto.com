### Preface

We highly recommend thinking about getting a hardware wallet or using MetaMask as a method to access you wallet and store your funds.

The following assumes you are **not** using a hardware wallet or MetaMask. Due to their ease of use and security, [we recommend a hardware wallet for cold storage](https://support.mycrypto.com/hardware-wallets/hardware-wallet-recommendations.html).

Remember to back up any wallets you create! Including the 12-word private seed phrase for your hardware wallets! MyCrypto <em>CAN NOT</em> recover any lost passwords or access accounts. MyCrypto only has access to information that is publicly avaliable on the blockchain. The security and responsibilty of your funds rests on your own shoulders! Though we will always be here for guidance and to answer any questions that you may have in how to be safe with your funds.  

### How To Create A New Wallet

* Go to [https://mycrypto.com/generate](https://mycrypto.com/generate).
* Choose your Wallet Style! We suggest to use a [Hardware Wallet](https://support.mycrypto.com/hardware-wallets/hardware-wallet-recommendations.html), [Metamask](https://metamask.io/), Parity Signer ([iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/parity-signer/id1218174838) or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nativesigner)



##### Congratulations! You've successfully create a wallet!

Things to double check:

* Unlock your new wallet using the method you chose to generate your wallet.  Ensure it unlocks the wallet you are sent to and matches the bookmark you have.
    * _Do not simply leave your new wallet open. Pretend you are coming back a year later to access your riches. Can you do it?_
* Send a small amount of Ether (0.0001 ETH) from your previous wallet or exchange to your new wallet's public address (The one beginning in '0x').
* Send a small amount of Ether (0.00001 ETH) from this new wallet to another address.
    * _Perhaps our donation address? We are a free, open-source service. There are no fees, no ads, no tracking, no cookies, no selling your data._
* Ensure you have recorded all necessary bits of information and the addresses match at all times. If they don't, you mis-wrote something somewhere. That means it's time to start from the beginning in order to make sure you never lose access to your funds.

Doing all of this is tedious, but it ensures you (1) have complete access to your funds (2) the address you sent to is correct and matches the private key you have saved and (3) you can rest easily for years to come, knowing you will be able to access your ETH later.

### Safe Storage of Backups

It is recommended that you store backups of both forms of your key (the Keystore or Mnemonic Phrase and paper wallet version) in physically separate, offline environments.

This prevents loss of the private key & password due to: dead hard drive, lost USB drive, wet piece of paper, etc. Keep in mind that physical loss can affect an entire area (e.g. fire, flood).

### We cannot recover your key

MyCrypto is not a web wallet and cannot recover your private key or password, access your account, move funds, recover funds, nor cancel/reverse transactions.

We are a client-side interface that allows you to interact with the Ethereum blockchain. Please secure & back up your key like the millions of dollars it could some day be worth.
