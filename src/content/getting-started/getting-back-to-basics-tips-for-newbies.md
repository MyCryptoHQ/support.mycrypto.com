### Tips

1. Never hand-type your address. If you copy and paste your address, do it [in incognito mode](https://www.wikihow.com/Activate-Incognito-Mode) and still take the time to double-check the address. This attack has not been seen yet, but a lot of Chrome extensions have access to the information that you copy and paste. Most extensions do not have access to incognito tabs by default but you can change this in your settings. (Contributed by @RaymondDurk - Thank You!)

2. Use the version of your address that [has uppercase letters.](https://support.mycrypto.com/addresses/my-ethereum-address-has-uppercase-and-lowercase-letters.html)

3. Never hand type your private key / keystore file / mnemonic phrase. Triple-check the words and the order of those words for mnemonic keys if you hand type them.

4. Always send a small amount of your crypto first, ensure it arrives at the destination you wanted it to, and then send the larger amount of that crypto.

5. For new wallets, especially [cold storage](https://support.mycrypto.com/offline/ethereum-cold-storage-with-mycrypto.html) wallets, send small amount in, send small amount **out**, and then send the full amount in. This ensures you can always access your cold crypto.

6. [Save and back up your private key](https://support.mycrypto.com/getting-started/backing-up-your-new-wallet.html) in a separate location BEFORE sending ETH/Tokens to it.

7. Never email your private key.

8. Never post your private key on Reddit, Twitter, Slack, Telegram, or in a support ticket.

9. Never store your private key on Dropbox, iCloud, Google Drive, or another cloud storage service.

10. Double & triple check your work. Look at what you are sending. Look at how much you are sending. Look at what address you are sending too.

Be careful.

### Hardware Wallets

One of the safest &amp; easiest ways to store your ETH, Tokens, ETC, BTC, and many other assets is via a <strong>Ledger</strong>, <strong>Trezor</strong>, or <strong>Keepkey</strong>. Hardware wallets are <strong>not</strong> just USB drives. They actually store your private key in super secure enclave, which ensures the private key **never** leaves your device. Phishers can't get them. Malware can't get them. Keyloggers can't get them. If you hold more than $200 worth of crypto, please invest in one of these hardware wallets: 

- [Buy a Ledger](https://www.ledgerwallet.com/r/1985?path=/products/)

- [Buy a Trezor](https://shop.trezor.io/?offer_id=10&aff_id=1735)

- [Buy a Keepkey](http://keepkey.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=1&aff_id=4086)

- [Ledger](https://www.ledgerwallet.com/r/1985?path=/products/)

- [Trezor](https://shop.trezor.io/?offer_id=10&aff_id=1735)

- [Keepkey](http://keepkey.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=1&aff_id=4086)

(Seriously, even if it's sold out, pre-order it now, it's worth it.)
