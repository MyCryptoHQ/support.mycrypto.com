**These phishers will not stop until they stop getting money or get caught.** We don't have the time or manpower to do it all. There are so many things to do and watch and document. We thank you for your help.

### 1. Educate when you see a message

- If you see a link to one of these sites or a fake Token Sale address, comment on it on Twitter or on Reddit or wherever. Warn people QUICKLY & LOUDLY.

> "There are scammers that are DMing, posting links, posting comments, and trying to get you to navigate to fake URLs. DO NOT CLICK IT!" (Yes. People still don't know this. I don't know where they are, obviously not here on reddit).

> Remind people: "If it's to good to be true, it probably is."

> ⚠ PSA! Do NOT click the link or listen to the scammer! That is a phishing site. Always check your URL and/or consider getting a Ledger or TREZOR hardware wallet.

### 2. Educate *before* you see a message

This is too much for one post so help spread the word: Private keys are *private*. Use hardware wallets. Use cold storage. Go offline. Check URLs.

*   Getting a [Ledger or Trezor Hardware Wallet](https://support.mycrypto.com/hardware-wallets/hardware-wallet-recommendations.html) is even better.

*   Never enter your private keys, passwords, sensitive data on a website that you were sent via message

*   ONLY unlock your wallet when you want to send a transaction. Check your balance via [https://etherscan.io/](https://etherscan.io/) or [https://ethplorer.io/](https://ethplorer.io/)

*   Do not trust messages or addresses or URLs sent via private message. Always verify information w/ a secondary source.
