Internal transactions, despite the name (which isn't part of the yellowpaper; it's a convention people have settled on) are not actual transactions. They are also not included directly in the blockchain; they are value transfers that were initiated by executing a smart contract (smart contract Ether or Token transfer).

Certain Ether and Token transfers require calling a smart contract to perform the transfer. These show up as internal transactions and are not indicated on the main ETH transaction history on etherscan.io. There should be a separate tab for "Internal Transactions" when you look up you wallet address in [etherscan.io](https://etherscan.io/)

When withdrawing, you need to make sure that the receiving address supports smart contracts, like MyCrypto.
