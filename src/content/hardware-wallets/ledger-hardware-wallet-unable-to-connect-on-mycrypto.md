Sample Error Message: *"Your Ledger is currently in use with another application. Please wait, or close other wallet applications before trying again."*

**Please try the following. This solves 99% of problems.**

*   If you are using MyCrypto.com + Ledger hardware wallet, make sure you have browser support turned ON. (This option is on the Ledger device itself under Settings)
*   If you are using the MyCrypto desktop application + Ledger hardware wallet, make sure browser support is turned OFF. (This option is on the Ledger device itself under Settings)
*   Restart your computer.
*   Try unplugging your hardware wallet and plugging it back in.
*   Try a different USB cable.
*   UseÂ Google Chrome.
*   Use the [MyCrypto Desktop App](https://download.mycrypto.com/).
*   Make sure you don't have any other apps that connect to your Ledger open (e.g. the Ledger Bitcoin Chrome app, Mist, etc.)
*   That you are confirming any transactions via your Ledger.
*   If you are using Linux and Ledger Nano, you may need to add udev rules as explained [here](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005165269-Fix-connection-issues) (under Linux section, scroll down)
