If you see the "U2F not supported" error, this means that your browser does not (properly) support the U2F protocol. This protocol is used by MyCrypto to connect with your hardware wallet.

To solve this issue, you can try using a different browser, such as Google Chrome. You can also use the [MyCrypto Desktop application](https://download.mycrypto.com/). If you are on Android and want to use your Ledger Wallet, you can try [using the Ledger U2F Bridge app](https://support.mycrypto.com/hardware-wallets/ledger-hardware-wallet-using-with-android.html).
