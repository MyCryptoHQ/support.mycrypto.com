* Update the firmware of your device.

* Don't leave your devices plugged in.

* Make sure your device is physically secure.

* Don't purchase pre-owned devices.

### Pre-Owned/Used Hardware Wallet Attacks

##### How is this done?

In this type of attack, an attacker would purchase hardware wallets, record the private keys of these wallets, and post the hardware wallets for resale on Amazon or Ebay. This works because hardware wallets are in demand, and often-times out of stock. People who aren't willing to wait for the main distributor to have stock.

The image below shows a hardware wallet posted for resale:
