## Identifying Your Provider

If you're a web3 wallet developer or user, you'll definitely want to have people see your name and logo when they browse MyCrypto with your browser:

It's easy to get that to happen, just [open a pull request](https://github.com/MyCryptoHQ/MyCrypto) with the following changes:

1. Add your logo to `common/assets/images/wallets/{provider}.svg`
   * Must be an SVG, must be #000 black, should be roughly square in shape.
2. Add the name of your provider to `common/translations/lang/en.json` as `X_{PROVIDER}`.
   * If you go by a different name in other languages, you can also add it to other language configs.
3. Add the logo and names to the configuration in `common/utils/web3.ts`'s `WEB3_CONFIGS` object.
   * The key of the `WEB3_CONFIGS` object should be the value of `web3.currentProvider.constructor.name`. You **must** ensure that this string is consistent, and not uglified as a part of your build. This has become the standard way of identifying providers, though we're open to better techniques as they come along.
