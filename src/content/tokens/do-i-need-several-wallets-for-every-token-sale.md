You do not need several wallets for every token sale. You can receive multiple ERC-20 tokens in a single wallet. If you wish to use multiple wallets, you have to make sure that each wallet contains a small amount of ETH in order to transfer the tokens out.

If you are not able to see the token after the token sale has completed, you might have to [add it as a custom token](https://support.mycrypto.com/tokens/adding-new-token-and-sending-custom-tokens.html).
