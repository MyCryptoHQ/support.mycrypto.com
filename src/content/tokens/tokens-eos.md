### How To Register EOS Tokens


We created an article on [our Medium page](https://medium.com/mycrypto) about registering your EOS tokens that you can find by clicking [here](https://medium.com/mycrypto/register-your-eos-easily-with-mycrypto-7c3854a39d50). The token sale ends on June 1, 2018 at 22:59:59 UTC, and is followed by a 48-hour grace period. Be sure to register your EOS tokens before this period ends.
