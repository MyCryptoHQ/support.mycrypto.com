## I Can't See My Token! How to Add a New ERC-20 Token

If you can't see a token when you access your wallet on MyCrypto, you simply just need to add it to your interface in order to see it and then send it in a transaction.

Any ERC-20 token can be added to your local MyCrypto interface by following these instructions.

1. After accessing your address, click the "Scan For Tokens" Button.

2. Your tokens should appear if the token is on our token list. If you have a balance you won't have to load it again â€” it will automatically load in the future.

### Accidentally Entered Incorrect Token Parameters

To remove a custom token, click the little ( - ) icon next to the token. This will remove it from the interface. It will not delete or remove the token from the wallet itself. They are still safely stored in your wallet, we promise.
