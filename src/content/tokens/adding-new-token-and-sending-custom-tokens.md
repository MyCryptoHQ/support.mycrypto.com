## I Can't See My Token! How to Add a New ERC-20 Token

If you can't see a token when you access your wallet on MyCrypto, you simply just need to add it to your interface in order to see it and so that you could send it in a transaction.

Any ERC-20 token can be added to your local MyCrypto interface by following these instructions.

### Make sure it isn't already in the list:

1. After accessing your address, click the Orange "Show All Tokens" Button.

2. Scroll and click the token you want to load, where it says "Click to Load". You can also use `cmd/ctrl`+`f` to search for a token on the list more quickly.

3. If you have a balance you won't have to load it again â€” it will automatically load in the future.

### Accidentally Input Incorrect Token Details

To remove a custom token, click the little ( - ) icon next to your token. This will remove it from the interface. It is not deleting or removing the tokens from the address itself. They are still safely in your address, we promise.
