A **mnemonic phrase** or **mnemonic seed** is a set of typically either 12 or 24 words, which can be used to derive an infinite number of wallets. Often times these phrases are used by cryptocurrency hardware wallets, to be written down on a piece of paper by the user to safely back up the users' funds.


In the Ethereum ecosystem, mnemonic phrases are generally generated following the [BIP 32](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki) spec. Popular hardware wallets, like Ledger and TREZOR, follow this spec, same applies to MetaMask. The mnemonic phrase generated by your wallet (usually) consists of 24 words, randomly selected from the [BIP 32 English wordlist](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039/english.txt), some wallets make use of a 12 word mnemonic phrase that are easier to remember.

## Encrypted mnemonic phrases

Many wallets provide an option to encrypt your mnemonic phrase with a password. This is useful as accessing your wallets would require you to have *something you have* (the mnemonic phrase) plus *something you know* (the password). Often times this is referred to as **13th/25th word/seed**.

### Plausible deniability

Since every password generates a valid seed, you could create a decoy wallet which has the same mnemonic phrase but uses a different password. If someone forces you to give them access to your wallets, you could provide the decoy password, and keep the real password (with all your funds) a secret.

<div class="alert alert-danger">
  Losing this password will result in you losing access to your wallets and funds.
</div>
